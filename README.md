# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project applies several machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease using a structured dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation with visualization.

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (with tuning)

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve

## 📊 Key Results

| Model               | Accuracy | ROC AUC |
|--------------------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression| 87.5%    | 0.87    |
| SVM                | 86.4%    | 0.93    |
| Tuned Random Forest| 85.9%    | 0.93    |

## 🔍 ROC Curve

The SVM model achieved the highest AUC score, indicating strong ability to distinguish between classes.
